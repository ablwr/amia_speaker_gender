<li>Chris Lacinak, AVPreserve</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaker</p>
<ul>
<li>Jon Dunn, Indiana University</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past decade much focus has been placed on mass digitization of legacy audiovisual collections. With progress on this front, today there is a new focus emerging: mass description.    In 2014 Indiana University (IU) began an effort to digitize hundreds of thousands of hours of audiovisual materials from across campus, leading to the challenge of describing this extraordinarily diverse set of materials both at scale and at a sufficient level of granularity to enable meaningful and effective discovery. In 2015, with the support of AVPreserve, IU began a strategic planning project to research, analyze and report on technologies, workflows, staffing, timeline and budgets to address this challenge.    With presentations from Jon Dunn and Chris Lacinak this session will offer insights into the leading-edge work occurring at IU and present some of the newest technologies and workflows available for rich description of, and improved access to audiovisual collections.</p>

<p>Human dependency on non-renewable fossil fuels has reached a critical point. Moving image archivists need to consider how to preserve moving image collections with lower dependence on fossil fuels or their derivative products by considering alternative energy solutions. This panel will address current understandings of the availability of fossil fuels, their negative effect on our environment, and discuss the emerging alternative technologies that are a critical part of our energy transition.</p>

<li>Lindsay Zarwell, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</li>
</ul>
<p>Traumatic Archives: Ethics and Accessibility looks at why United States Holocaust Memorial Museum makes its digitized oral history and films collections available on the web. Much of the collection contains sensitive material that can be difficult to watch.The Museum is unique in how accessible it has made its oral testimony and historic films, particularly in the field of Holocaust history.     Film archivist Lindsay Zarwell brings years of experience collecting and cataloging this traumatic material. Rebecca Dillmeier is the digital collections manager for oral history and historic film and has been involved in discussions regarding why certain oral testimony collections should be accessible onsite only as well as helping to audit release forms and donor records. They have helped shape the institution&#8217;s policies regarding accessibility. This discussion allows for the audience to grapple with issues of institutional loss of control over a narrative and what role an institution plays in mediating graphic material.</p>

<p>Regarded as the definitive work on the Civil Rights Movement, the documentary series, Eyes on the Prize, has been seen by millions since its PBS debut in 1987.  However, what remains unseen is the nearly 85 hours of interview outtakes that provide further insight into the series’ original stories of struggle, resistance, and perseverance.  Through the Eyes on the Prize Digitization and Reassembly project, funded by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, Washington University Libraries is making the complete, never-before-seen interviews and synchronized transcripts freely accessible through its newly developed Hydra digital repository. Crawford Media Services, Inc. completed the digitization and the digital reassembly was completed in-house. This session will provide both archivist and vendor insights into planning, workflow management, and the related challenges of implementing large-scale digitization projects.</p>

</ul>
<p>The MTV Vault project, started in 2013, is the initiative to transform the footage tape library, which consists of production source tapes, master tapes and audio source tapes, into a curated digital library. The MTV Vault project allows Viacom the ability to better leverage the value of their content for reuse and provides the opportunity to increase revenue while preserving the Music Group legacy. The project is broken out into 3 tracks: 1. Researching and Discovery of the Most Valued Tapes for Digitization. 2. Encoding Tapes Externally. Tapes 3. Metadata- Standardization and Logging at Clip Level. In this case study we would like to present the steps that were taken in order for Viacom to support the digitization and preservation of these assets and look at the logistical, operational and technical strategies we employed to get us to where we are today. We’ll outline processes, the teams, the technologies. In addition, we&#8217;ll recognize our successes combined with project challenges both present and past.</p>

<p>“Re-Envisioning Japan: Japan as Destination in Visual and Material Culture” (REJ) is a multimedia digital archive of tourism, travel and educational ephemera documenting changing images of Japan and its place in the world in the early to mid 20th century. The recuperation and digital presentation of small gauge ephemeral films in context is a key objective of this collaborative project between faculty and library staff at the University of Rochester. Now in its 5th year as a large-scale, ongoing project, REJ had humble beginnings. It is a useful case study for colleagues similarly working at the intersection of academic and archival practice. Topics include the creative digital curation of ephemeral films for research, teaching, and general interest, the innovative use of open-source tools for digitally restoring and presenting films, and solutions for successfully planning and developing similar projects in the context of a library digital humanities center.</p>

<p>While a large number of AMIA members are women, and many do “techie” work, we do not often see them leading the discussion, or being deferred to as experts. Female faces are often absent from the presentation side of our technological symposia. We want to find ways to encourage women in our field to become leaders, through presenting at technology-oriented events, writing for our periodicals, organizing events at our conference, or speaking up on the list-serv and in public. This open discussion is an opportunity to investigate the problems we are facing, and to identify solutions. Why are women underrepresented? What can we do to change that? We believe an open forum will lead to creative thinking and problem solving, possibly a new network of support, and will shine the light of personal experience on a neglected topic. We hope the issues raised in this session will flavor conversations during the conference.</p>

</ul>
<p>Alternative Archives will explore the intersection of personal narrative and moving image archiving. African-Americans are often written out of the narrative of history, but renewed interest in oral histories and home movies have provided a platform for an important conversation on the role archives play in documenting and preserving the personal histories of African-Americans. Inherently structured differently than traditional moving image archives, archives that collect home movies or oral histories develop more personal relationships with their donors and their communities. We also face different challenges in preserving and sharing our material. This panel will examine the great benefits and rewards of collecting personal histories, but also tackle the challenges and roadblocks that housing such rich material activates.</p>

<p>This session will examine the shared experiences of three major repositories in the health field (Johns Hopkins, National Library of Medicine, and Wellcome Library) in managing material one might not expect to find in medical archives. Unique materials such as home movies, travel, ethnographic, archeological, and research films are often created or collected during the course of clinical, epidemiological, or other work. These films present challenges for curators, who must decide whether and how to prioritize, catalog, and digitize this unusual material within established workflows, and how to develop and engage new audiences for it. The session will be enlivened and evidenced with examples of unusual films from the three archival film collections.</p>

<li>Eva Radding, Facing History and Ourselves</li>
<li>Kara Van Malsen, AVPreserve</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2012 Facing History and Ourselves set out to fundamentally change its management and use of its media collections. In the past four years, this educational non-profit has done just that. Starting with inaccessible legacy media, inconsistent distribution mechanisms, and media management challenges, Facing History has successfully digitized its legacy media, established policies for born digital production, implemented and rolled out a DAM, established a taxonomy, and integrated with a web content management system and an online video platform. This case study will outline the process, challenges and value of this transformation and what it has meant to Facing History.</p>

<p>Preserving Nairobi heritage through audio visual archiving: The UNH Project.   The Unlocking Nairobi Heritage (UNH) project is aimed at giving the key to the world, it will help unlock the Nairobi they don’t know, the Nairobi they know and the Nairobi they would like to remember.   The Audio visual collection at the Nairobi City County Government has not been given the deserved attention. Currently, the audio visual records are decentralized and some might be lost for lack of knowledge on how to handle them for the purposes of preservation and continuation of the County’s heritage. The County has records that span from the Council era 1950 till 2012 before the County Government was formed, hence the dire need to properly preserve them as they form the rich history of Nairobi City.   A virtual Archive link has been created in the Official Website where all the relevant images and video recordings are being uploaded.   The presenters, as they make their presentation, will communicate the efforts being put in place at Nairobi County in the preservation of AV records for posterity.</p>

</ul>
<p>The forerunner of today’s IMAX system, the Magnascope process provided silent-era audiences with a greatly enlarged picture during select sequences through the use of a short focal length lens. Unlike later widescreen systems that used new film gauges, modified projector gates, or anamorphic lens attachments, the Magnascope system was relatively cheap and could be used in conjunction with existing 35mm prints. Introduced by Paramount Pictures with the 1926 release of “Old Ironsides,” Magnascope was long assumed to have petered out after a handful of releases. New research indicates that the process lingered on for two decades, with Magnascope-branded presentations continuing at the discretion of individual exhibitors. Renewed interest in this variated and localized exhibition history brings together scholars, archivists, and repertory programmers. Many archives already possess titles that were originally exhibited in Magnascope and can recreate the Magnascope experience for modern audiences without undertaking additional preservation or digitization initiatives.</p>

<p>The Community Archiving Workshop (CAW) model is growing. Now going into its 7th year, the CAW Organizing Committee proposes to establish regional coalitions, which will serve as anchors for local AV preservation efforts. The CAW proposes to meet increasing demand with the establishment of a Training of Trainers curriculum that can be disseminated widely in partnership with regional archives and organizations. Next steps for the CAW include the development of a Training of Trainers curriculum, an enhanced Organizer&#8217;s Toolkit and support to strengthen regional networks for AV preservation. In this session we will solicit feedback and suggestions from AMIA members who have participated in past workshops and/ or who are interested in delivering workshops in their own regional communities. Documentation and data collected from this day will play an essential role to the further development of the CAW model and subsequent toolkit and training.</p>

</ul>
<p>Launched in April 1956, 2” quad videotape became the dominant broadcast format for more than two decades. Networks were the first adopters, but as early as 1958 local stations were taping their own programming—everything from documentaries to breaking news to performances by local musicians. The economics of 2” tape, however, meant that tapes were frequently re-used by local producers, and thus are now relatively rare. This session, marking the 60th Anniversary of videotape, will give a technical and historical overview of the format, but more importantly, showcase a diverse array of newly-discovered and preserved local programming that originated on 2”, from stations across the country.</p>

<p><strong>11:00am</strong><strong>  From Virtual to Reality: Dissecting Jennifer Steinkamp’s Software-Based Installation</strong></p>
<p>Speaker</p>
<ul>
<li>Shu-Wen Lin, NYU Moving Image Archiving and Preservation</li>
</ul>
<p>Time-based and digital art combines media and technology that challenges traditional conservation practices while requiring dedicated care. As a pioneer in media art, contemporary artist Jennifer Steinkamp is critically acclaimed for her abilities to weave digital media into large-scale installations that envelop the audience vis-a-vis streams of moving images. In this paper, I use Steinkamp’s animated installation Botanic that was exhibited in Times Square Arts: Midnight Moment as a case study. Through carefully disassembling the artist’s creation process, I attempt to focus on the internal structure and relationship between Maya, After Effects, scripts, and final deliverables. I strive to provide a risk assessment that will enable museum professionals as well as the artist herself to identify sustainability and compatibility of digital elements in order to build a documentation that can collect and preserve the whole spectrum of digital objects related to the piece.</p>

</ul>
<p>Accepted standards and best practices for audiovisual archiving usually emerge from institutional contexts (e.g. libraries, universities, professional organizations), and are not always applicable or sufficient when working with community-based groups or alternative media-makers. How do archivists working in traditional institutions foster more reciprocal and collaborative relationships with communities to preserve their histories? What are the affective, emotional, or other social dynamics involved with archiving documentation of police violence? What are some lessons learned from participatory approaches to archiving the work of independent artists and the collections of grassroots media distributors? This panel will examine the particular challenges of working in these contexts, and the practices that emerge from them.</p>

<p>Developed in the 1970s as a method for providing expanded access to television programming for the hearing-impaired, closed captions (CC) are carried in line 21 of the NTSC video signal. When analog video is converted to an uncompressed digital file, closed captions are preserved. They can, however, become scrambled when compression is introduced, which presents a key challenge to institutions interested in preserving CC functionality in access copies of preserved video. This panel explores three institutions’ CC struggles and solutions in preserving video collections, serving a large base of deaf and blind users, and handling CC in library streaming. This session will focus on the technical issues including transfer workflows, hardware and software considerations, and creating access copies both in-house and with a vendor. Lastly, the session aims to broaden the moving image archival community’s interpretation of access.</p>

<p>Provenance is one of the primary tenets of the archival profession.  Yet when cataloging moving images, the focus tends to be on item and content level description, while the collections’ provenance and significance remains in staff members’ heads, personal filing systems or as unasked questions.  Often paper resources accompanying a moving image collection remain segregated without any attempt to intellectually integrate them.  In this panel discussion, Mike Brostoff and Stephen Danley will discuss the structure and workflows the Academy Film Archive developed to organize staff into collection teams with the goal of documenting collection level provenance and other related contextual information.   Stephanie Sapienza will then lead a demonstration about how contextual paper documentation can enhance understanding of related media collections, using some examples from current and developing projects.</p>

<p>Speaker</p>
<ul>
<li>Allie Whalen</li>
</ul>
<p>Artists, activists, and archivists embrace do-it-yourself strategies at times of political and social unrest for free expression, communication, and survival of marginalized voices. Between 1950 and 1990, political suppression paradoxically sparked creative action across the underground arts scene of Eastern Europe from secret concerts, actions, and happenings to self-published zines and media. This presentation explores salvaged collections hidden behind the Iron Curtain, how artists became accidental archivists, and where collections once concealed in basements or confiscated by secret police have ended up today and how they are being preserved. Case studies describe the methodologies of archives throughout Europe where independent and community archiving actions are taking place despite limited environments to safeguard these collections, and how prominent figures from the underground scene are active in archiving. This presentation stems from on-site research for my 2015 MIAP thesis &#8220;I Will Counterrevolution / I Will Stop All The Motion: Archiving Exile, Samizdat, and Underground Audio from the Eastern Bloc&#8221;.</p>

<p>Working as an archivist in a production/media environment is in many ways a different experience and requires a somewhat different skill set than working as an archivist in a cultural heritage setting. It is an ever-changing process. Archival conventions and traditional standards often do not apply. A production archive must be adaptable, flexible, and inclusive in order to fulfill its mission and meet the needs of its users. Mette Charis Buchman, Senior Manager at The Archive at the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and Karma Foley, Director of Library &amp; Archives at Smithsonian Channel will elaborate on the particular challenges and opportunities of archiving in a production/media environment. The session will allow for information sharing among production archives and may spark ideas for archivists working in other environments.</p>

<p>This program will present a set of short works followed by a discussion by Tony Buba, an independent filmmaker who uses documentary as a form of community activism in the Pittsburgh area. As president of Braddock Films, Tony Buba has been producing documentaries since 1972 in both long and short formats. In addition to producing personal work, Braddock Films has been involved in producing award winning documentaries in the Pittsburgh area. He has focused his energies on the crumbling landscape of Braddock, Pennsylvania, a once-thriving steel town, whose people and environments have been directly affected by the age of post-industrial decline.</p>

<p>The original digital intermediate was defined and used as a tool to aid in the creative color and visual effects processes for features shot on 35mm film.  It was commonly delivered in 2K resolution in 10bit LOG DPX format representing film density in order to create film outs for theatrical exhibition.  For these titles, this deliverable represented the highest quality picture asset and can be used to support future distribution needs.    Today, production is a mix of digital and film based capture and commonly includes advanced visual effects.  With the transition to digital cinema, the Digital Intermediate has skewed towards delivery in P3 color space, which may not preserve the highest resolution, color or dynamic range of the production sources.  This limitation could impact the ability to service higher quality standards in the future.</p>

<p>Examinations of the development of moving image archival and preservation educational programs have been dominated by the United States and Europe, and historically educational efforts outside of the aforementioned areas haven&#8217;t been included in these discussions. This session will focus on diversity in educational methodologies and environments being used in the field, featuring participants from Latin America, Canada, and the U.S, and including topics such as academic instruction in audio-visual and digital preservation, collection management, inclusive pedagogy, and oral history, experience with online classes and instructional technology, plus opportunities provided by independent courses, institutional partnerships, workshop series, fellowships, and residencies. The session will also explore assessment of educational efforts, development of measurable outcomes, and leveraging of the profession&#8217;s multidisciplinary background, and focus on future needs of the profession and current gaps in educational access and approaches.</p>

<p>Speaker</p>
<ul>
<li>Kate Pourshariati, Penn Museum</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a special film screening session. The film La Belle at the Cinema is about the lack of any remaining cinemas in Kinshasa, capitol of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The filmmaker takes a wider view of filmmaking in this central African country, interviewing filmmakers from the Congo and visiting several film libraries languishing in poor storage in national television stations. This is a great film for archivists; it addresses the meaning of cinema in culture and considers the loss of the collective viewing experience, which is fairly common in Africa today and increasingly common in the USA.</p>

<p>Speakers</p>
<ul>
<li>Jennifer Jenkins, University of Arizona</li>
<li>Hanni Nabahe, University of Arizona</li>
</ul>
<p>We explore handling and access issues surrounding historical moving image records of Native sacred ceremonies. The Yaqui Easter ceremonies in Southern Arizona and Northern Mexico were recorded by tribal invitation by ethnographic filmmaker Tad Nichols in the 1940s. Those films entered into University general collections and have been reproduced as new formats came available. Since NAGPRA (1996) and the issuance of the Protocols for Native American Archival Materials (2008), tribal peoples have sought to reclaim sacred images, both moving and still, as a matter of sovereignty. A larger collection of educational, industrial, and amateur films, the American Indian Film Gallery, also contains footage of sacred ceremonies, many filmed without permission or in direct defiance of tribal wishes. We examine contemporary best practices documents and compare content management systems as means of reclaiming image sovereignty.</p>

</ul>
<p>In this session, archivists from the Black Film Center/Archive (BFC/A) at Indiana University will report on the progress of the Richard E. Norman and Race Filmmaking: Reprocessing and Digitization project, initiated in 2015 with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities Division of Preservation and Access.  Following the reintegration of Norman’s dispersed holdings and the publication of a new finding aid in 2015, work is underway on a collection-wide digital access project, making the collection available freely online, including personal and business correspondence, distribution records, censorship reports, photographs, production documentation, and promotional and exhibition materials created between 1912 and 1954.  In addition to reporting on the current digitization project, the BFC/A aims to open discussion with session attendees of how this new body of digital raw material might provide a foundation for building new inter-institutional collaborations to facilitate advanced digital scholarship on early African American cinema and movie-going.</p>

</ul>
<p>This panel brings together archivists and scholars to discuss the process of identifying, finding, working with, and documenting the filmmakers, subjects, and other personnel involved in producing nontheatrical films. Through specific cases and representative anecdotes, panelists will focus on the opportunities, challenges, legal issues, and ethics involved in such work. We will also explore the use of technological tools (such as the Media Ecology Project and other database systems) in working with nontheatrical film and how we might best go about the labor of documenting hitherto undocumented films, which often suffer from a unique form of neglect and a lack of context that differentiates them from most of their their theatrical counterparts.     More of a discussion session than a series of formal presentations, each panelists will briefly share some experiences regarding the overarching panel topic and will then take place in a discussion, including participation from attendees, with regard to best practices for archivists and scholars working with undocumented nontheatrical film history.</p>

<p><strong>2:00pm</strong><strong>    Opening the Archive: Mobile Media Preservation and Collection Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Speaker</p>
<ul>
<li>Natalie Cadranel, OpenArchive</li>
</ul>
<p>A presentation for moving image archivists interested in collecting, preserving, and amplifying audiovisual mobile media. Citizens armed with mobile devices are becoming history’s first responders, amassing rich, contextualized, and crucial historical documentation. However, the media they create is incredibly fragile and difficult to verify, often disappearing as a result of privacy concerns, data loss, or a lack of affordable, secure cloud storage; if shared, the most common destination for this media is on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are not committed to privacy, authentication, or long-term preservation.     Attendees will learn about the mobile application OpenArchive, which aims to foster a virtual commons where civil liberties are protected, and media retains its provenance once shared online.</p>

</ul>
<p>This panel presentation looks at the Smithsonian’s NMAAHC and the Library of Congress to discuss real-world challenges in maintaining fixity across a large-scale, multi-year, cross-institutional, oral history video production project. It considers the example of 8TB (+800 files) of born-digital video content from 2012 wherein major data portions were discovered in 2016 to be corrupted. While digital preservation practices change rapidly, this “FAIL” case study highlights the need for mature repositories to revisit previously ingested content to ensure quality control protocol that includes navigating changes in staff. In analyzing the successful file recovery, the panelists will detail the variety of quality control tools and practical workflows used by each institution to ingest and recover corrupt files. Lack of documentation regarding file provenance along with their workflow history made locating the point of failures a very challenging process, requiring a variety of ivestigative methods, both technical and manual. In analyzing the points of failures, both institutions gained a greater understanding of how their respective repositories manage and care for files, leading to broader knowledge of the different approaches and micro-systems that digital collection ecosystems employed at various institutions.</p>

<p>Speaker</p>
<ul>
<li>James Snyder, Library of Congress</li>
</ul>
<p>Standards created the physical and file-based media whose content we preserve.   Standards are now taming the wild west which exists with the vendor-specific technology-based data sets of digitized content now being created, from audiovisual files to metadata, to cataloging records.  But what about the data as a whole?  How you plan, select and implement data storage hardware and software determines your data set&#8217;s long term survivability.  This session will cover:  How to design a data set for the long-term survival both of the content itself and other data set being stored over time;  The new data archiving standard AXF (the Archive eXchange Format, SMPTE standard 2034-1), how its designed for long-term data survival, the current &amp; future hardware &amp; software problems it&#8217;s designed to solve, and how it is being implemented; How to design workflows and choose technologies and/or data set vendors wisely.</p>

</ul>
<p>Starting in the late 1990s, scholars, archivists, and, most importantly, grant makers became interested in preserving orphan films. But the national movement to preserve orphan works missed the fact that many of the films they made prominent, including local films, homes movies, and amateur films, were already circulating, as VHS tapes and, later, DVDs, in the communities where they were made. In this panel, we will explore strategies for identifying, processing, and preserving these “community copies,” and the lessons they impart for making these films legible to present and future audiences.</p>

How can students and new professionals best leverage professional development opportunities? How is the prevalence of unpaid internships and skyrocketing student loan debt impacting the profession? What is the employment outlook for job seekers? What continuing education opportunities are available to moving image archivists? What is the professional growth climate for those looking to eventually move to higher-level positions?</p>

<p>Throughout 2015 and 2016, Media Burn Archive collaborated with Kartemquin Films to create the first public access to collections of camera-original footage from KTQ’s archive. Since 1966, KTQ has been making documentaries that examine and critique society through the stories of real people. Their films, such as The Interrupters and Hoop Dreams, are among the most acclaimed of all time, leaving a lasting impact on millions of viewers.    The panelists will discuss the rationale for prioritizing the preservation of camera-original footage and ways to engage the public with the digital access, the risk factors specific to the long-term survival of independently produced work from the videotape era, the complexities of creating and sustaining a formal archive at an active production company, as well as how to frame a mutually beneficial structure for an archive to create access to a collection held by an outside organization.</p>
