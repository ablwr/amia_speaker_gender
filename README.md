# Scrape & analyze

Grabs data from current and historical Association of Moving Image Archivists conferences, runs through gender processing algorithm, exports analyzed data.

N.B.: This is scrap-code that only works enough for me to grab the data I needed and manipulate the rest "by hand"; not a robust application.

Updated to just use via copy-pasting into terminal/irb. A fuller application is not necessary when the code works just fine.
